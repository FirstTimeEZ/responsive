-------------------------------

# Structure

The website's files are organized within the `/website` folder, which contains subdirectories for images, JavaScript files, and styles. 

```
/website
├── /imgs
├── /js
│   ├── /exports
│   │   └── tags.js
│   └── main.js
├── /style
│   └── responsive.css
└── index.html
```

The `index.html` file uses `js/main.js`, which is responsible for loading the JavaScript modules from the `js/exports` folder.
